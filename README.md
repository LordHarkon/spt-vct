# SPT-VCT (Variable Construction Time)

This mod allows you to adjust the construction speed of your hideout buildings.

By default, the mod reduces construction time to 10% of the normal duration. You can customize this setting in the config.js file.

Please ensure the multiplier is set to a positive value. Setting it too high may cause unintended issues in the game. Use at your own risk.
